# **UFOs**

**Objective**: The objective of this project is to prepare a website that the user can interact with visualizations and filter through the data.

**Summary**:  JavaScript and HTML programming languages are used to prepare the website and summarize UFO data in a form of a dynamic table. The website give the user the option to filter through parameters to narrow down the search based on the date, city, state, country  and shape of the UFOs. 

**Technologies Used:** To prepare the website, JavaScript, and HTML languages were used. A css file was used for styling the website and an image was imported for the background. 

**Recommendations for further analysis:** In order to further analyze the data, it is recommended to use the "durationMinutes" to filter the data. We can categorize the duration to:

- Less than minute
- One minute to 5 minutes
- More than 5 minutes

This would help the user to eliminate the data that was seen briefly that might have an error.
